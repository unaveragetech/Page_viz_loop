# GitHub Profile Feedback Exploitation

## Overview
GitHub provides various types of feedback on profile activity, which can be visually represented through badges. These badges can indicate visitor counts and profile views, and they can be leveraged for specific purposes, such as monitoring engagement or manipulating perceived popularity.

## Types of Profile Feedback

### 1. Visitor Count Badge
The Visitor Count Badge tracks the number of unique visitors to your GitHub profile. This badge can be displayed on your profile README to showcase how many people have visited your page.

- **How to Use**: 
  To display the visitor count badge, you can use the following Markdown:
  ```markdown
  ![Visitor Count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=YOUR_GITHUB_NAME)
  ```
  Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_NAME` with your actual GitHub username. For example, if your username is `unaveragetech`, the line will be:
  ```markdown
  ![Visitor Count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=unaveragetech)
  ```

### 2. Profile Views Badge
The Profile Views Badge counts the total number of views your GitHub profile has received. This is useful for showing how many people are interested in your projects.

- **How to Use**:
  To display the profile views badge, you can use the following Markdown:
  ```markdown
  ![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=YOUR_GITHUB_NAME)
  ```
  Again, replace `YOUR_GITHUB_NAME` with your actual GitHub username. For example, for the username `unaveragetech`, you would use:
  ```markdown
  ![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=unaveragetech)
  ```

## Summary
By incorporating these badges into your GitHub profile README, you can effectively showcase the level of interest and engagement with your profile. Simply replace `YOUR_GITHUB_NAME` with your actual GitHub username in the provided Markdown snippets to track your profileâ€™s visitor count and view count.
